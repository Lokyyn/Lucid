# Lucid
Lucid is a free WinForms control library with theming, docking and other functionality. This repository builds upon *[DarkUI](https://github.com/RobinPerris/DarkUI)* which is no longer actively maintained. Recognizing this, I decided to enhance it by incorporating my own features that align with my specific requirements. By doing so, I have transformed my private repository into a standalone repository, ready to be shared with the community.

**Feel free to use this in your own projects.**

*NOTE: I will occasionally dedicate time to work on this repository, but please note that new features will be introduced sporadically. If you come across any bugs, I kindly request you to create an issue so that I can address them accordingly.*
